# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

### How It Works

Users must contact the Admin via WhatsApp to create an account.
The Admin will ask for specific details, including the preferred
username and password. As soon as the Admin receives the required
information, an account will be created.

Users receive a WhatsApp notification once the account is set up
by the Admin. Users can then log in with their username and
password to access the platform, where they can browse available
profiles.

If a user finds an interesting profile, user need to like the
profile and contact the Admin to request the contact details and
address information of the profile. Upon verification, the Admin
will provide the necessary details via WhatsApp.
